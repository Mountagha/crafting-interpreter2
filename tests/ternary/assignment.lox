var a = 5;
var b = 3;
var max;

// seems C does not allow assignment inside operator ?:
// but C++ does. We support it mainly because it is 
// the easiest path I think lol. Was lazy doing the 
// other way around.

var d = a > b ? max = a : max = b;

print max; // should print 5

print d; // should print 3
