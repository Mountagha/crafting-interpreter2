We can substitute an OP_SUBSTRACT by a combination of an OP_NEGATE and an OP_ADD.
this would reduce the bytecode instructions set but would make the generated bytecode
longer. (2 instructions instead of one for each -)
In term of performance after timing some execution we did not notice any improvement. Seems like
it does not optimize execution. We kept the changement there but commented it.

doing the negation on place seems to save a bit of time. OP_NOT could benefit of the same 
optimization. (notice it by observing time taken to compute fibonnacci.)

chap19-chall1:
Flexible array members for ObjString chars members added.

chap19-chall2:
Let come back later ;)

chap19-chall3:
when trying to concatenate a string with another type we raise an error and exit as done
in python interpreter. Other language implicitely convert the other type to string and 
do the concatenation. We choose not to.
